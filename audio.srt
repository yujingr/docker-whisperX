1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,434
OK, so welcome to the Deep Dive.

2
00:00:02,695 --> 00:00:11,606
Today, we're looking at John Mackey, the co-founder of Whole Foods Market and his book, The Whole Story, Adventures in Love, Life, and Capitalism.

3
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:12,688
Yeah, it's quite something.

4
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:21,840
The sources you shared give us this really intimate look at how Whole Foods came to be and how it really shifted how people thought about food in America.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,541
Absolutely.

6
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,625
And it's tied so closely to Mackey's own life.

7
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:29,650
So our mission today is really to unpack those key moments, right?

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,868
What did it take to build this company and how did his personal journey kind of weave into that?

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,775
Exactly.

10
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:44,045
We've got excerpts covering, well, everything from his really early days, founding Staperway, which became Whole Foods, of course, the challenges, the growth.

11
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,608
Personal stuff, his whole business philosophy evolving.

12
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:46,828
Right.

13
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:53,115
It promises a look into building, as the description says, a long, healthy, purposeful life in all its different facets.

14
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:53,355
Yeah.

15
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,196
And we'll dig into that.

16
00:00:54,557 --> 00:01:04,007
How his experiences, you know, hitchhiking philosophy, deep dives, boardroom fights, even spiritual stuff, how all that shaped Whole Foods in his own views.

17
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:05,052
It should be interesting.

18
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:07,862
Probably some surprises along the way as we trace this whole thing.

19
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:08,665
OK, let's jump in.

20
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:15,752
Starting right back in Austin around 1975, 78, the story opens with him hitchhiking.

21
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:18,419
Yeah, it sets this immediate tone, doesn't it?

22
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,626
Like, a real eagerness for adventure, maybe a bit fearless, but without a clear... map, you know?

23
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:26,147
Totally.

24
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:29,170
He even says something like, I don't really care, I'll go wherever you're going.

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,751
Just wants to be moving.

26
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:36,998
You wonder how much that early comfort with the unknown played into his later, well, jumping into business.

27
00:01:37,278 --> 00:01:38,760
That willingness to just start.

28
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,520
Good point.

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,263
That kind of, let's figure it out as we go attitude.

30
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:43,746
And it wasn't just wandering, though.

31
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:48,652
He gets deep into existentialist philosophy with Professor Robert Solomon.

32
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:50,273
Found it really honest, apparently.

33
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:51,014
Right.

34
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:54,879
Existentialism focusing on, like, individual choice and finding meaning.

35
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:57,522
Makes sense that would appeal to someone trying to figure things out.

36
00:01:57,662 --> 00:01:58,704
But then there's a shift.

37
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,106
He has some kind of powerful personal experience.

38
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:04,150
The book sort of hints it might have been psychedelic.

39
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:05,628
Yeah, it does hint at that.

40
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:08,913
And suddenly existentialism feels wanting.

41
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:10,015
It's missing something.

42
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:10,415
Right.

43
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:19,649
He starts focusing more on happiness, adventure, love, joy, less purely intellectual, more about lived experience, connection.

44
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,652
So this seems like a big turn.

45
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:24,096
How does that lead him towards something like Prana House?

46
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,954
Well, that focus on experience and community seems to fit, right?

47
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:33,143
Piranha House was a co-op, shared living, shared responsibilities, a real community focus.

48
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:36,048
And it's there he gets into a transcendental meditation TM.

49
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:38,832
Yeah, part of the whole seeking, exploring vibe.

50
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,116
But then comes the reality check.

51
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:44,582
Starting a business, safer way, with Renee Lawson Hardy.

52
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:45,317
Exactly.

53
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:52,188
Suddenly, you know, co-op meetings and meditation time or maybe clashing with the sheer amount of work needed to get a store off the ground.

54
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:53,671
Classic tension, isn't it?

55
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:57,277
Ideals versus the practical grind of a startup.

56
00:02:57,297 --> 00:02:59,060
You have to make choices, sacrifices.

57
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,681
For sure.

58
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:03,286
And speaking of practicalities, funding Safer Way wasn't easy.

59
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:04,809
No, it sounds like it was pieced together.

60
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,954
Some money from his dad, his dad's friend Don Schaffer.

61
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:08,278
Yeah.

62
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,624
Typical early seed funding, tapping into personal networks.

63
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:15,810
But his dad, Bill Mackey, becomes more involved over time.

64
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,715
Not just cash, but advice, mentorship.

65
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,702
It sounds like business became a way for them to connect maybe more than they had before.

66
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:24,343
Seems that way.

67
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:28,670
His dad was a successful businessman, so that expertise was invaluable.

68
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,112
A real support system there.

69
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:32,216
And they weren't just funding it, they were building it.

70
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:36,422
Renovating that old Victorian house themselves because they couldn't afford contractors.

71
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:37,484
Wow, yeah.

72
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:39,066
That's dedication.

73
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:40,449
Real sweat equity.

74
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:42,393
Doing everything because you have to.

75
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:43,875
Then they hit the bureaucracy wall.

76
00:03:44,677 --> 00:03:45,418
City permits.

77
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:46,560
Licenses.

78
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:49,706
The usual nightmare for new businesses.

79
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:50,027
Uh-huh.

80
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:51,409
Sounds incredibly frustrating.

81
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:53,553
Like, the system is almost designed to stop you.

82
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,577
But then this stranger gives them this advice.

83
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,783
Basically, don't wait for the city, just open.

84
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:00,165
Whoa.

85
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:01,721
That's bold advice.

86
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:04,929
And they took it, decided to open up and sort out the paperwork later.

87
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:08,799
It's a bit risky, maybe, but sometimes you just have to move, right?

88
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,127
Definitely shows that impatience to get the vision realized.

89
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:14,593
Willingness to bend the rules a bit, maybe.

90
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:16,925
And the vision wasn't just selling stuff.

91
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:18,307
It was about values, wasn't it?

92
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:21,472
Animals not suffering for food, food from farms.

93
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:21,913
Yeah.

94
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:25,278
Reflecting their hopes for their customers, for the world, really.

95
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:28,663
That mission beyond just profit was there right from the start.

96
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:31,187
Sets the stage for the Whole Foods brand later.

97
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:36,655
So they finally open Safer Way and things immediately go from just busy to, what did he say?

98
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:37,736
Flat out crazy.

99
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:38,077
Huh.

100
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:38,698
Yeah.

101
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:40,260
Sounds about right for a launch.

102
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,003
The demands just explode, taking over everything.

103
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:44,866
It even forces them out of the co-op.

104
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:45,506
Yeah.

105
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:47,008
They needed a new place to live.

106
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:48,350
Warehouse space.

107
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,753
Life just gets consumed by the business.

108
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,595
That's the classic startup story, isn't it?

109
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:53,917
Everything else takes a backseat.

110
00:04:54,258 --> 00:04:55,679
And we see some early friction, too.

111
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,567
The restaurant part of Safer Ways struggled financially, and Mackey admits he unfairly blamed Rene.

112
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:03,589
Yeah, partnership stress.

113
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,434
Learning those hard lessons about shared responsibility, communication.

114
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:10,298
It's crucial, but often painful early on.

115
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:14,807
To get answers, he starts hitchhiking again, this time to Houston to get advice from his dad.

116
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:16,789
Turning back to that mentor figure.

117
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,652
And his dad's advice is pretty fundamental.

118
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:20,653
Read.

119
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,195
Learn the basics of business.

120
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:25,038
It's like getting a crash course MBA on the road.

121
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:25,979
Pretty much.

122
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:29,282
Passion is great, but you need the know-how, too.

123
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:30,644
You need the strategy.

124
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:33,166
And you see that strategic thinking start to click.

125
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:39,593
Mackey realizes bigger orders mean better prices, thinking beyond just their store.

126
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:45,133
Yeah, understanding the supply chain, the economics, moving from just running a shop to thinking like a bigger business.

127
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:51,022
Yeah, there's that nice little story about Craig Weller and Mark Skills at Clarksville Natural Grocery and the cookie incident.

128
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:51,522
Oh, yeah.

129
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:56,710
Illustrates that real customer focus, that community feel, something Mackey really admired.

130
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,573
It shows the kind of values he wanted, right?

131
00:05:58,753 --> 00:05:59,975
More than just a transaction.

132
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:00,676
Definitely.

133
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:04,221
But even with all that, they lost money that first year, $23,000.

134
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:04,582
Wow.

135
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:09,529
But he still felt the potential, it sounds like, just

136
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,312
Could they learn fast enough to survive?

137
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:15,218
That's the million dollar question for any startup, isn't it?

138
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,260
That tightrope walk.

139
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:19,948
The loss is real, but so is the optimism, the learning curve.

140
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:24,457
So after that first intense year, Renee suggests a trip.

141
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:24,978
New Zealand.

142
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:25,960
A break.

143
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:27,062
Smart idea.

144
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,104
Burnout is real.

145
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:31,872
Even when things are exciting, you got to sustain the people, not just the business.

146
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:34,659
And that break seems to spark the next step.

147
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:40,845
Coming back, Renee apparently encourages him to go pitch his father for more significant funding for a bigger vision.

148
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:46,570
Interesting how that confidence from her helped him approach his dad, who sounds like a pretty formidable debater.

149
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,494
Yeah, Mackie describes their debates almost like a game, something he enjoyed.

150
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:53,357
That resilience probably helped in business, too.

151
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:55,099
Facing challenges head on.

152
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,422
So the idea for a larger store starts to take shape.

153
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,285
They even go on a tour, checking out other natural food stores.

154
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:07,335
Like Erwan, Mrs. Gooch's, seeing what was working elsewhere, getting validation for a bigger format.

155
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:07,695
Right.

156
00:07:07,756 --> 00:07:11,722
Moving from just an idea to seeing tangible examples, building confidence.

157
00:07:11,742 --> 00:07:14,106
But he doesn't just want to build his own bigger store.

158
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:17,551
He wants to team up with Craig and Mark from Clarksville.

159
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:21,618
Thinks merging could create the dominant natural food store in Austin.

160
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,641
He respected their expertise.

161
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:25,905
But Craig was hesitant at first.

162
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:27,577
Yeah, merging isn't simple.

163
00:07:27,737 --> 00:07:32,046
Combining two established operations, cultures, it takes work.

164
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:34,310
But Mackie saw the synergy.

165
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:35,713
And then the naming process.

166
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:39,541
Trying to find the right identity for this merged venture.

167
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:44,130
Rejecting Safer Way and Clarksville Natural Grocery.

168
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:45,314
Yeah, a bit clunky.

169
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:48,700
And landing on Whole Foods Market, much broader, right?

170
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,025
Signifies a bigger ambition than just combining two stores.

171
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:52,726
Definitely.

172
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:56,853
A name change signaling a real evolution in the vision.

173
00:07:56,913 --> 00:07:58,336
It wasn't just Safer Way anymore.

174
00:07:58,356 --> 00:08:01,060
So what was the concept for this new Whole Foods Market?

175
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:04,566
Bigger, for sure, but also maybe less

176
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:11,057
Dogmatic about purity, more service, less restrictive, and a big emphasis on education.

177
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:11,497
Right.

178
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:12,479
An information center.

179
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:13,521
Empowering the customer.

180
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:15,364
That feels pretty forward thinking for the time.

181
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:15,624
Yeah.

182
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:17,467
Making knowledge a key part of the offering.

183
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,090
And they wanted knowledgeable staff, too.

184
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,594
Like Karen Seid is tough knowledge test for hires.

185
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,335
Exactly.

186
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:29,187
And Mark Skeels is walk with me interview style, setting expectations for a fast paced, high energy, building a specific kind of team.

187
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:35,918
In Craig Weller, he's described as the quintessential grocer, bringing that deep, practical know-how.

188
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:37,640
You need that grounding, right?

189
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:41,246
The person who really understands the nuts and bolts of the grocery business.

190
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:45,593
But even with the merger agreed upon, things weren't perfect just before opening.

191
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:49,559
Sounds like they were short on inventory, still had issues to iron out.

192
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,222
Merging on paper is one thing.

193
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:53,866
Integrating operations is another beast entirely.

194
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:55,369
Logistics, systems.

195
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,811
It takes time.

196
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:58,860
And the feel of the store was important too.

197
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:00,924
Renee's influence again.

198
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:01,404
Yeah.

199
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:09,057
Moving away from the maybe grungy feel of Safer Way, but also avoiding the sterile feel of regular supermarkets.

200
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:13,424
Aiming for something warm, colorful, showcasing the food itself.

201
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:15,087
Using aesthetics as part of the brand.

202
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:17,406
Recognizing that customer experience matters.

203
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:19,829
It's not just the products, it's the whole environment.

204
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:21,452
And then the grand opening.

205
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:21,972
Yeah.

206
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:24,756
Huge success, doing over $200,000 a week.

207
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:26,479
Yeah, blowing past expectations.

208
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,341
Massive validation for the whole concept.

209
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:29,363
A real triumph.

210
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:31,346
But that success was tested pretty quickly, wasn't it?

211
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:33,288
That hundred year flood in their first year.

212
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:34,290
Oh man, yeah.

213
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:35,572
Devastating.

214
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:37,374
A massive crisis right out of the gate.

215
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:39,036
But it also showed something amazing.

216
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:41,520
Customers just showing up to help.

217
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:43,723
Like that guy Larry volunteering.

218
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:44,783
Incredible.

219
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:47,125
It really speaks to the community they had built, doesn't it?

220
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:50,789
That loyalty, maybe those early values paid off in unexpected ways.

221
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:55,654
That disaster really tested their resilience and getting through it required more help.

222
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:56,015
Right.

223
00:09:56,155 --> 00:10:03,603
Securing that loan from Citi National Bank, that introduction from Karl Martin to Mark Monroe was crucial.

224
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:07,326
A bank willing to bet on their potential even after a flood?

225
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:08,428
That's significant.

226
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:10,690
Access to capital when you desperately need it.

227
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,501
And around this time they also start realizing the power of specialization, division of labor.

228
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:19,430
Kind of funny, like they rediscovered this basic business principle on their own.

229
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:19,891
Huh.

230
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:20,513
Yeah.

231
00:10:20,974 --> 00:10:22,978
But it's a key step in becoming more efficient.

232
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:24,021
Scaling up.

233
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:25,945
Learning as they go.

234
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:30,881
The early team sounds like it was really tight-knit, a fellowship holding meetings in homes.

235
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:36,808
That camaraderie, that shared purpose must have been vital during those tough, demanding early years.

236
00:10:37,128 --> 00:10:42,254
And they kept that focus on quality, visiting suppliers personally, making sure relationships were strong.

237
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:47,460
Reinforcing those core values, building trust all the way down the supply chain.

238
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:49,743
But the personal side keeps weaving in.

239
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:52,506
Mackie and Renee's relationship ends.

240
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:55,510
Yeah, that conversation about seeing other people

241
00:10:55,827 --> 00:11:00,315
Leading to the breakup, the personal toll of entrepreneurship is always there.

242
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:05,104
And given how closely they work together from the start, that must have had an impact on the business too.

243
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:05,625
For sure.

244
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,649
And maybe it fuels the next step.

245
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,676
After the breakup, Mackie starts looking for a second store location.

246
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:16,029
Driven by that desire to replicate, to grow, the ambition kicks in again.

247
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,373
Yeah, the first store worked, now let's scale it.

248
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:20,276
Classic entrepreneurial drive.

249
00:11:20,476 --> 00:11:22,058
But new complications arise.

250
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,126
He starts a relationship with an employee, Cheryl, which Craig advises against.

251
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:31,232
Yeah, workplace relationships can be tricky, especially for a founder.

252
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:32,854
Adds another layer of complexity.

253
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:36,499
And tension grows with Mark's gallows over this very idea of expansion.

254
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:39,604
Mark seems happy with the one successful store.

255
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:40,012
Right.

256
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:44,538
He's resistant to more growth, more risk, while Mackey is pushing for it.

257
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:46,620
That sets up a core conflict, doesn't it?

258
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,042
Stability versus growth.

259
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:49,964
Different visions for the future.

260
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:57,252
A really common dynamic in founding teams as a company matures, risk tolerance changes, ambitions diverge.

261
00:11:57,373 --> 00:12:00,877
They start exploring Houston for expansion, but it's tough.

262
00:12:00,897 --> 00:12:03,019
Different market, different culture than Austin.

263
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:03,480
Yeah.

264
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,005
Proving that what works in one place doesn't just automatically work everywhere else, you have to adapt.

265
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,430
You mentioned Houston being maybe more conventional.

266
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:13,614
How might that have shown up for a natural food store back then?

267
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:18,882
Well, Austin had that strong counterculture base, maybe more early adopters.

268
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:31,439
Houston, being larger, more diverse, might have needed a different approach, different product mix, maybe more education needed, less assumption of familiarity with natural foods, just a different vibe to connect with.

269
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,060
Makes sense.

270
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:36,726
Around this time, Peter Roy proposes the Natural Foods Network idea.

271
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:45,091
Yeah, a way for independent stores like theirs to collaborate, share best practices, kind of differentiate themselves from the old school health food stores.

272
00:12:45,352 --> 00:12:48,736
Building a wider community, strengthening the whole sector, not just whole foods.

273
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:49,216
Exactly.

274
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:51,019
Collaboration amidst competition.

275
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,062
Meanwhile, Mackie's personal journey continues.

276
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:57,306
He gets into breathwork, introduced by someone named Jackie.

277
00:12:57,907 --> 00:12:59,389
More spiritual exploration.

278
00:12:59,538 --> 00:12:59,939
Yeah.

279
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,322
And this leads to him grappling with some big ideas.

280
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:08,671
How does this feeling of unity he's experiencing fit with, you know, the competitive free market?

281
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:12,637
He's reading economists like Friedman and Hayek who champion competition.

282
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:13,078
Right.

283
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:15,621
So Friedman and Hayek, they're big on free markets, right?

284
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:20,869
Competition, individual self-interest, driving efficiency, limited government.

285
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:21,890
That's the core idea.

286
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:27,478
So how does that square with Mackey's experiences of interconnectedness or unity?

287
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,600
It seems like a clash.

288
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,281
Exactly.

289
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:30,222
That's the tension.

290
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:37,873
How can a business operate ethically, maybe with a sense of shared purpose within a system that theoretically runs on competition and self-interest?

291
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:41,138
He's trying to reconcile these seemingly opposing forces.

292
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:48,428
And while he's wrestling with philosophy, the conflict with Mark comes to a head, especially after something called the Wildflower Cafe fails.

293
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:49,954
Yeah, that seems to be a flashpoint.

294
00:13:50,274 --> 00:13:53,999
Mark sees Mackey's push for growth, maybe some failures along the way, as reckless.

295
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,922
Calls him a terrible CEO, apparently.

296
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:56,502
Wow.

297
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,205
So it becomes a real power struggle.

298
00:13:58,345 --> 00:13:58,926
Absolutely.

299
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:03,371
A confrontation over the company's direction, Mackey's leadership, everything.

300
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,335
Differing views on risk and growth boiling over.

301
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:12,964
So looking back as we wrap up, John Mackey's story with Whole Foods is just so deeply tied to his own personal evolution, isn't it?

302
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:13,749
Absolutely.

303
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:20,259
From that adventurous questioning kid to a well still questioning but much more pragmatic businessman.

304
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,060
Those early days.

305
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,142
So much passion.

306
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:23,423
Community spirit.

307
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:25,106
Just getting hands dirty.

308
00:14:25,126 --> 00:14:29,272
Navigating crazy challenges like floods and city permits.

309
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:29,853
Yeah.

310
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:33,979
And that tension we saw especially with Mark between wanting to grow and wanting stability.

311
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,982
That's such a common business theme.

312
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:43,313
And Mackey's own openness to new retail ideas, sure, but also to things like TM and breathwork that clearly shaped him and the company.

313
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:44,054
Definitely.

314
00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:48,701
And thinking about the book's title, The Whole Story, and that idea of a purposeful life.

315
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:49,342
Right.

316
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:55,511
Makes you think how those early seeds, the adventure, the philosophy, the co-op community, weren't just about building a business.

317
00:14:55,991 --> 00:15:03,522
No, they were laying the groundwork for a whole life philosophy, one that tried to blend personal growth with, you know, conscious business.

318
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,701
So here's something to maybe chew on.

319
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:19,720
Reflecting on Mackie's early motivations, those initial drives and challenges, the search for meaning, the desire for adventure, building community, facing setbacks, what parts of that resonate with how you think about crafting your own whole story?

320
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:22,523
Yeah, definitely something to ponder.

321
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:23,164
It is.

322
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:25,307
Well, thanks for taking this deep dive with us today.
