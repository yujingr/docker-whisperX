WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:02.434
OK, so welcome to the Deep Dive.

00:02.695 --> 00:11.606
Today, we're looking at John Mackey, the co-founder of Whole Foods Market and his book, The Whole Story, Adventures in Love, Life, and Capitalism.

00:11.706 --> 00:12.688
Yeah, it's quite something.

00:12.728 --> 00:21.840
The sources you shared give us this really intimate look at how Whole Foods came to be and how it really shifted how people thought about food in America.

00:22.040 --> 00:22.541
Absolutely.

00:22.921 --> 00:25.625
And it's tied so closely to Mackey's own life.

00:26.105 --> 00:29.650
So our mission today is really to unpack those key moments, right?

00:29.630 --> 00:33.868
What did it take to build this company and how did his personal journey kind of weave into that?

00:34.034 --> 00:34.775
Exactly.

00:34.995 --> 00:44.045
We've got excerpts covering, well, everything from his really early days, founding Staperway, which became Whole Foods, of course, the challenges, the growth.

00:44.125 --> 00:46.608
Personal stuff, his whole business philosophy evolving.

00:46.628 --> 00:46.828
Right.

00:46.948 --> 00:53.115
It promises a look into building, as the description says, a long, healthy, purposeful life in all its different facets.

00:53.155 --> 00:53.355
Yeah.

00:53.375 --> 00:54.196
And we'll dig into that.

00:54.557 --> 01:04.007
How his experiences, you know, hitchhiking philosophy, deep dives, boardroom fights, even spiritual stuff, how all that shaped Whole Foods in his own views.

01:04.088 --> 01:05.052
It should be interesting.

01:05.172 --> 01:07.862
Probably some surprises along the way as we trace this whole thing.

01:07.943 --> 01:08.665
OK, let's jump in.

01:09.569 --> 01:15.752
Starting right back in Austin around 1975, 78, the story opens with him hitchhiking.

01:16.357 --> 01:18.419
Yeah, it sets this immediate tone, doesn't it?

01:18.479 --> 01:25.626
Like, a real eagerness for adventure, maybe a bit fearless, but without a clear... map, you know?

01:25.686 --> 01:26.147
Totally.

01:26.347 --> 01:29.170
He even says something like, I don't really care, I'll go wherever you're going.

01:29.790 --> 01:30.751
Just wants to be moving.

01:30.992 --> 01:36.998
You wonder how much that early comfort with the unknown played into his later, well, jumping into business.

01:37.278 --> 01:38.760
That willingness to just start.

01:39.060 --> 01:39.520
Good point.

01:39.660 --> 01:42.263
That kind of, let's figure it out as we go attitude.

01:42.344 --> 01:43.746
And it wasn't just wandering, though.

01:43.786 --> 01:48.652
He gets deep into existentialist philosophy with Professor Robert Solomon.

01:48.952 --> 01:50.273
Found it really honest, apparently.

01:50.314 --> 01:51.014
Right.

01:51.054 --> 01:54.879
Existentialism focusing on, like, individual choice and finding meaning.

01:54.919 --> 01:57.522
Makes sense that would appeal to someone trying to figure things out.

01:57.662 --> 01:58.704
But then there's a shift.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.106
He has some kind of powerful personal experience.

02:01.247 --> 02:04.150
The book sort of hints it might have been psychedelic.

02:04.366 --> 02:05.628
Yeah, it does hint at that.

02:05.888 --> 02:08.913
And suddenly existentialism feels wanting.

02:09.233 --> 02:10.015
It's missing something.

02:10.155 --> 02:10.415
Right.

02:10.676 --> 02:19.649
He starts focusing more on happiness, adventure, love, joy, less purely intellectual, more about lived experience, connection.

02:20.330 --> 02:21.652
So this seems like a big turn.

02:21.973 --> 02:24.096
How does that lead him towards something like Prana House?

02:24.228 --> 02:27.954
Well, that focus on experience and community seems to fit, right?

02:28.034 --> 02:33.143
Piranha House was a co-op, shared living, shared responsibilities, a real community focus.

02:33.203 --> 02:36.048
And it's there he gets into a transcendental meditation TM.

02:36.068 --> 02:38.832
Yeah, part of the whole seeking, exploring vibe.

02:39.233 --> 02:41.116
But then comes the reality check.

02:41.136 --> 02:44.582
Starting a business, safer way, with Renee Lawson Hardy.

02:44.596 --> 02:45.317
Exactly.

02:45.337 --> 02:52.188
Suddenly, you know, co-op meetings and meditation time or maybe clashing with the sheer amount of work needed to get a store off the ground.

02:52.449 --> 02:53.671
Classic tension, isn't it?

02:54.212 --> 02:57.277
Ideals versus the practical grind of a startup.

02:57.297 --> 02:59.060
You have to make choices, sacrifices.

02:59.220 --> 02:59.681
For sure.

02:59.941 --> 03:03.286
And speaking of practicalities, funding Safer Way wasn't easy.

03:03.347 --> 03:04.809
No, it sounds like it was pieced together.

03:05.530 --> 03:07.954
Some money from his dad, his dad's friend Don Schaffer.

03:08.018 --> 03:08.278
Yeah.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.624
Typical early seed funding, tapping into personal networks.

03:12.285 --> 03:15.810
But his dad, Bill Mackey, becomes more involved over time.

03:15.950 --> 03:18.715
Not just cash, but advice, mentorship.

03:19.115 --> 03:23.702
It sounds like business became a way for them to connect maybe more than they had before.

03:23.782 --> 03:24.343
Seems that way.

03:24.844 --> 03:28.670
His dad was a successful businessman, so that expertise was invaluable.

03:29.011 --> 03:30.112
A real support system there.

03:30.192 --> 03:32.216
And they weren't just funding it, they were building it.

03:32.917 --> 03:36.422
Renovating that old Victorian house themselves because they couldn't afford contractors.

03:36.622 --> 03:37.484
Wow, yeah.

03:38.245 --> 03:39.066
That's dedication.

03:39.127 --> 03:40.449
Real sweat equity.

03:40.469 --> 03:42.393
Doing everything because you have to.

03:42.473 --> 03:43.875
Then they hit the bureaucracy wall.

03:44.677 --> 03:45.418
City permits.

03:45.999 --> 03:46.560
Licenses.

03:47.963 --> 03:49.706
The usual nightmare for new businesses.

03:49.726 --> 03:50.027
Uh-huh.

03:50.047 --> 03:51.409
Sounds incredibly frustrating.

03:51.429 --> 03:53.553
Like, the system is almost designed to stop you.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.577
But then this stranger gives them this advice.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.783
Basically, don't wait for the city, just open.

03:59.323 --> 04:00.165
Whoa.

04:00.398 --> 04:01.721
That's bold advice.

04:01.882 --> 04:04.929
And they took it, decided to open up and sort out the paperwork later.

04:05.872 --> 04:08.799
It's a bit risky, maybe, but sometimes you just have to move, right?

04:08.819 --> 04:12.127
Definitely shows that impatience to get the vision realized.

04:12.448 --> 04:14.593
Willingness to bend the rules a bit, maybe.

04:14.742 --> 04:16.925
And the vision wasn't just selling stuff.

04:16.945 --> 04:18.307
It was about values, wasn't it?

04:18.848 --> 04:21.472
Animals not suffering for food, food from farms.

04:21.632 --> 04:21.913
Yeah.

04:21.993 --> 04:25.278
Reflecting their hopes for their customers, for the world, really.

04:25.318 --> 04:28.663
That mission beyond just profit was there right from the start.

04:29.063 --> 04:31.187
Sets the stage for the Whole Foods brand later.

04:31.347 --> 04:36.655
So they finally open Safer Way and things immediately go from just busy to, what did he say?

04:36.995 --> 04:37.736
Flat out crazy.

04:37.796 --> 04:38.077
Huh.

04:38.397 --> 04:38.698
Yeah.

04:39.098 --> 04:40.260
Sounds about right for a launch.

04:40.460 --> 04:43.003
The demands just explode, taking over everything.

04:43.103 --> 04:44.866
It even forces them out of the co-op.

04:45.146 --> 04:45.506
Yeah.

04:45.526 --> 04:47.008
They needed a new place to live.

04:47.429 --> 04:48.350
Warehouse space.

04:49.031 --> 04:50.753
Life just gets consumed by the business.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.595
That's the classic startup story, isn't it?

04:52.716 --> 04:53.917
Everything else takes a backseat.

04:54.258 --> 04:55.679
And we see some early friction, too.

04:56.480 --> 05:01.567
The restaurant part of Safer Ways struggled financially, and Mackey admits he unfairly blamed Rene.

05:02.428 --> 05:03.589
Yeah, partnership stress.

05:04.030 --> 05:07.434
Learning those hard lessons about shared responsibility, communication.

05:07.735 --> 05:10.298
It's crucial, but often painful early on.

05:10.362 --> 05:14.807
To get answers, he starts hitchhiking again, this time to Houston to get advice from his dad.

05:15.127 --> 05:16.789
Turning back to that mentor figure.

05:17.730 --> 05:19.652
And his dad's advice is pretty fundamental.

05:20.333 --> 05:20.653
Read.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.195
Learn the basics of business.

05:22.515 --> 05:25.038
It's like getting a crash course MBA on the road.

05:25.298 --> 05:25.979
Pretty much.

05:26.519 --> 05:29.282
Passion is great, but you need the know-how, too.

05:29.502 --> 05:30.644
You need the strategy.

05:30.844 --> 05:33.166
And you see that strategic thinking start to click.

05:33.927 --> 05:39.593
Mackey realizes bigger orders mean better prices, thinking beyond just their store.

05:39.725 --> 05:45.133
Yeah, understanding the supply chain, the economics, moving from just running a shop to thinking like a bigger business.

05:45.373 --> 05:51.022
Yeah, there's that nice little story about Craig Weller and Mark Skills at Clarksville Natural Grocery and the cookie incident.

05:51.122 --> 05:51.522
Oh, yeah.

05:51.663 --> 05:56.710
Illustrates that real customer focus, that community feel, something Mackey really admired.

05:56.950 --> 05:58.573
It shows the kind of values he wanted, right?

05:58.753 --> 05:59.975
More than just a transaction.

06:00.155 --> 06:00.676
Definitely.

06:00.836 --> 06:04.221
But even with all that, they lost money that first year, $23,000.

06:04.341 --> 06:04.582
Wow.

06:06.645 --> 06:09.529
But he still felt the potential, it sounds like, just

06:10.589 --> 06:12.312
Could they learn fast enough to survive?

06:12.713 --> 06:15.218
That's the million dollar question for any startup, isn't it?

06:15.359 --> 06:16.260
That tightrope walk.

06:16.481 --> 06:19.948
The loss is real, but so is the optimism, the learning curve.

06:20.289 --> 06:24.457
So after that first intense year, Renee suggests a trip.

06:24.477 --> 06:24.978
New Zealand.

06:25.619 --> 06:25.960
A break.

06:26.281 --> 06:27.062
Smart idea.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.104
Burnout is real.

06:28.205 --> 06:31.872
Even when things are exciting, you got to sustain the people, not just the business.

06:31.936 --> 06:34.659
And that break seems to spark the next step.

06:34.679 --> 06:40.845
Coming back, Renee apparently encourages him to go pitch his father for more significant funding for a bigger vision.

06:41.265 --> 06:46.570
Interesting how that confidence from her helped him approach his dad, who sounds like a pretty formidable debater.

06:46.791 --> 06:50.494
Yeah, Mackie describes their debates almost like a game, something he enjoyed.

06:51.015 --> 06:53.357
That resilience probably helped in business, too.

06:53.657 --> 06:55.099
Facing challenges head on.

06:55.139 --> 06:58.422
So the idea for a larger store starts to take shape.

06:58.442 --> 07:01.285
They even go on a tour, checking out other natural food stores.

07:01.265 --> 07:07.335
Like Erwan, Mrs. Gooch's, seeing what was working elsewhere, getting validation for a bigger format.

07:07.455 --> 07:07.695
Right.

07:07.756 --> 07:11.722
Moving from just an idea to seeing tangible examples, building confidence.

07:11.742 --> 07:14.106
But he doesn't just want to build his own bigger store.

07:14.507 --> 07:17.551
He wants to team up with Craig and Mark from Clarksville.

07:17.772 --> 07:21.618
Thinks merging could create the dominant natural food store in Austin.

07:22.039 --> 07:23.641
He respected their expertise.

07:24.302 --> 07:25.905
But Craig was hesitant at first.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.577
Yeah, merging isn't simple.

07:27.737 --> 07:32.046
Combining two established operations, cultures, it takes work.

07:32.807 --> 07:34.310
But Mackie saw the synergy.

07:34.651 --> 07:35.713
And then the naming process.

07:36.515 --> 07:39.541
Trying to find the right identity for this merged venture.

07:39.801 --> 07:44.130
Rejecting Safer Way and Clarksville Natural Grocery.

07:44.212 --> 07:45.314
Yeah, a bit clunky.

07:45.494 --> 07:48.700
And landing on Whole Foods Market, much broader, right?

07:48.860 --> 07:52.025
Signifies a bigger ambition than just combining two stores.

07:52.306 --> 07:52.726
Definitely.

07:53.247 --> 07:56.853
A name change signaling a real evolution in the vision.

07:56.913 --> 07:58.336
It wasn't just Safer Way anymore.

07:58.356 --> 08:01.060
So what was the concept for this new Whole Foods Market?

08:01.261 --> 08:04.566
Bigger, for sure, but also maybe less

08:05.407 --> 08:11.057
Dogmatic about purity, more service, less restrictive, and a big emphasis on education.

08:11.297 --> 08:11.497
Right.

08:11.517 --> 08:12.479
An information center.

08:12.499 --> 08:13.521
Empowering the customer.

08:13.581 --> 08:15.364
That feels pretty forward thinking for the time.

08:15.404 --> 08:15.624
Yeah.

08:15.684 --> 08:17.467
Making knowledge a key part of the offering.

08:17.487 --> 08:19.090
And they wanted knowledgeable staff, too.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.594
Like Karen Seid is tough knowledge test for hires.

08:21.734 --> 08:22.335
Exactly.

08:22.716 --> 08:29.187
And Mark Skeels is walk with me interview style, setting expectations for a fast paced, high energy, building a specific kind of team.

08:29.167 --> 08:35.918
In Craig Weller, he's described as the quintessential grocer, bringing that deep, practical know-how.

08:36.298 --> 08:37.640
You need that grounding, right?

08:37.701 --> 08:41.246
The person who really understands the nuts and bolts of the grocery business.

08:41.607 --> 08:45.593
But even with the merger agreed upon, things weren't perfect just before opening.

08:46.194 --> 08:49.559
Sounds like they were short on inventory, still had issues to iron out.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.222
Merging on paper is one thing.

08:51.483 --> 08:53.866
Integrating operations is another beast entirely.

08:53.987 --> 08:55.369
Logistics, systems.

08:56.110 --> 08:56.811
It takes time.

08:56.977 --> 08:58.860
And the feel of the store was important too.

08:59.641 --> 09:00.924
Renee's influence again.

09:01.084 --> 09:01.404
Yeah.

09:01.665 --> 09:09.057
Moving away from the maybe grungy feel of Safer Way, but also avoiding the sterile feel of regular supermarkets.

09:09.418 --> 09:13.424
Aiming for something warm, colorful, showcasing the food itself.

09:13.444 --> 09:15.087
Using aesthetics as part of the brand.

09:15.303 --> 09:17.406
Recognizing that customer experience matters.

09:17.706 --> 09:19.829
It's not just the products, it's the whole environment.

09:19.849 --> 09:21.452
And then the grand opening.

09:21.732 --> 09:21.972
Yeah.

09:22.193 --> 09:24.756
Huge success, doing over $200,000 a week.

09:24.836 --> 09:26.479
Yeah, blowing past expectations.

09:26.579 --> 09:28.341
Massive validation for the whole concept.

09:28.522 --> 09:29.363
A real triumph.

09:29.383 --> 09:31.346
But that success was tested pretty quickly, wasn't it?

09:31.846 --> 09:33.288
That hundred year flood in their first year.

09:33.569 --> 09:34.290
Oh man, yeah.

09:34.911 --> 09:35.572
Devastating.

09:35.772 --> 09:37.374
A massive crisis right out of the gate.

09:37.695 --> 09:39.036
But it also showed something amazing.

09:39.838 --> 09:41.520
Customers just showing up to help.

09:42.061 --> 09:43.723
Like that guy Larry volunteering.

09:44.142 --> 09:44.783
Incredible.

09:44.843 --> 09:47.125
It really speaks to the community they had built, doesn't it?

09:47.145 --> 09:50.789
That loyalty, maybe those early values paid off in unexpected ways.

09:50.989 --> 09:55.654
That disaster really tested their resilience and getting through it required more help.

09:55.794 --> 09:56.015
Right.

09:56.155 --> 10:03.603
Securing that loan from Citi National Bank, that introduction from Karl Martin to Mark Monroe was crucial.

10:03.663 --> 10:07.326
A bank willing to bet on their potential even after a flood?

10:07.647 --> 10:08.428
That's significant.

10:08.788 --> 10:10.690
Access to capital when you desperately need it.

10:10.670 --> 10:15.501
And around this time they also start realizing the power of specialization, division of labor.

10:15.722 --> 10:19.430
Kind of funny, like they rediscovered this basic business principle on their own.

10:19.751 --> 10:19.891
Huh.

10:20.212 --> 10:20.513
Yeah.

10:20.974 --> 10:22.978
But it's a key step in becoming more efficient.

10:23.439 --> 10:24.021
Scaling up.

10:24.863 --> 10:25.945
Learning as they go.

10:26.195 --> 10:30.881
The early team sounds like it was really tight-knit, a fellowship holding meetings in homes.

10:31.181 --> 10:36.808
That camaraderie, that shared purpose must have been vital during those tough, demanding early years.

10:37.128 --> 10:42.254
And they kept that focus on quality, visiting suppliers personally, making sure relationships were strong.

10:42.675 --> 10:47.460
Reinforcing those core values, building trust all the way down the supply chain.

10:47.961 --> 10:49.743
But the personal side keeps weaving in.

10:49.803 --> 10:52.506
Mackie and Renee's relationship ends.

10:52.887 --> 10:55.510
Yeah, that conversation about seeing other people

10:55.827 --> 11:00.315
Leading to the breakup, the personal toll of entrepreneurship is always there.

11:00.355 --> 11:05.104
And given how closely they work together from the start, that must have had an impact on the business too.

11:05.204 --> 11:05.625
For sure.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.649
And maybe it fuels the next step.

11:08.190 --> 11:11.676
After the breakup, Mackie starts looking for a second store location.

11:11.723 --> 11:16.029
Driven by that desire to replicate, to grow, the ambition kicks in again.

11:16.170 --> 11:18.373
Yeah, the first store worked, now let's scale it.

11:18.613 --> 11:20.276
Classic entrepreneurial drive.

11:20.476 --> 11:22.058
But new complications arise.

11:22.679 --> 11:27.126
He starts a relationship with an employee, Cheryl, which Craig advises against.

11:28.067 --> 11:31.232
Yeah, workplace relationships can be tricky, especially for a founder.

11:31.512 --> 11:32.854
Adds another layer of complexity.

11:33.094 --> 11:36.499
And tension grows with Mark's gallows over this very idea of expansion.

11:37.381 --> 11:39.604
Mark seems happy with the one successful store.

11:39.652 --> 11:40.012
Right.

11:40.433 --> 11:44.538
He's resistant to more growth, more risk, while Mackey is pushing for it.

11:44.858 --> 11:46.620
That sets up a core conflict, doesn't it?

11:46.800 --> 11:48.042
Stability versus growth.

11:48.723 --> 11:49.964
Different visions for the future.

11:50.385 --> 11:57.252
A really common dynamic in founding teams as a company matures, risk tolerance changes, ambitions diverge.

11:57.373 --> 12:00.877
They start exploring Houston for expansion, but it's tough.

12:00.897 --> 12:03.019
Different market, different culture than Austin.

12:03.099 --> 12:03.480
Yeah.

12:03.500 --> 12:08.005
Proving that what works in one place doesn't just automatically work everywhere else, you have to adapt.

12:08.187 --> 12:10.430
You mentioned Houston being maybe more conventional.

12:11.151 --> 12:13.614
How might that have shown up for a natural food store back then?

12:14.215 --> 12:18.882
Well, Austin had that strong counterculture base, maybe more early adopters.

12:19.482 --> 12:31.439
Houston, being larger, more diverse, might have needed a different approach, different product mix, maybe more education needed, less assumption of familiarity with natural foods, just a different vibe to connect with.

12:31.599 --> 12:32.060
Makes sense.

12:32.801 --> 12:36.726
Around this time, Peter Roy proposes the Natural Foods Network idea.

12:36.841 --> 12:45.091
Yeah, a way for independent stores like theirs to collaborate, share best practices, kind of differentiate themselves from the old school health food stores.

12:45.352 --> 12:48.736
Building a wider community, strengthening the whole sector, not just whole foods.

12:48.756 --> 12:49.216
Exactly.

12:49.256 --> 12:51.019
Collaboration amidst competition.

12:51.379 --> 12:54.062
Meanwhile, Mackie's personal journey continues.

12:54.503 --> 12:57.306
He gets into breathwork, introduced by someone named Jackie.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.389
More spiritual exploration.

12:59.538 --> 12:59.939
Yeah.

12:59.959 --> 13:02.322
And this leads to him grappling with some big ideas.

13:02.843 --> 13:08.671
How does this feeling of unity he's experiencing fit with, you know, the competitive free market?

13:08.892 --> 13:12.637
He's reading economists like Friedman and Hayek who champion competition.

13:12.857 --> 13:13.078
Right.

13:13.258 --> 13:15.621
So Friedman and Hayek, they're big on free markets, right?

13:16.082 --> 13:20.869
Competition, individual self-interest, driving efficiency, limited government.

13:20.889 --> 13:21.890
That's the core idea.

13:22.091 --> 13:27.478
So how does that square with Mackey's experiences of interconnectedness or unity?

13:27.639 --> 13:28.600
It seems like a clash.

13:28.580 --> 13:29.281
Exactly.

13:29.301 --> 13:30.222
That's the tension.

13:30.603 --> 13:37.873
How can a business operate ethically, maybe with a sense of shared purpose within a system that theoretically runs on competition and self-interest?

13:38.334 --> 13:41.138
He's trying to reconcile these seemingly opposing forces.

13:41.318 --> 13:48.428
And while he's wrestling with philosophy, the conflict with Mark comes to a head, especially after something called the Wildflower Cafe fails.

13:48.492 --> 13:49.954
Yeah, that seems to be a flashpoint.

13:50.274 --> 13:53.999
Mark sees Mackey's push for growth, maybe some failures along the way, as reckless.

13:54.260 --> 13:55.922
Calls him a terrible CEO, apparently.

13:56.282 --> 13:56.502
Wow.

13:56.883 --> 13:58.205
So it becomes a real power struggle.

13:58.345 --> 13:58.926
Absolutely.

13:59.026 --> 14:03.371
A confrontation over the company's direction, Mackey's leadership, everything.

14:03.552 --> 14:06.335
Differing views on risk and growth boiling over.

14:06.556 --> 14:12.964
So looking back as we wrap up, John Mackey's story with Whole Foods is just so deeply tied to his own personal evolution, isn't it?

14:13.028 --> 14:13.749
Absolutely.

14:13.969 --> 14:20.259
From that adventurous questioning kid to a well still questioning but much more pragmatic businessman.

14:20.299 --> 14:21.060
Those early days.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.142
So much passion.

14:22.542 --> 14:23.423
Community spirit.

14:23.824 --> 14:25.106
Just getting hands dirty.

14:25.126 --> 14:29.272
Navigating crazy challenges like floods and city permits.

14:29.633 --> 14:29.853
Yeah.

14:29.893 --> 14:33.979
And that tension we saw especially with Mark between wanting to grow and wanting stability.

14:34.019 --> 14:35.982
That's such a common business theme.

14:36.063 --> 14:43.313
And Mackey's own openness to new retail ideas, sure, but also to things like TM and breathwork that clearly shaped him and the company.

14:43.514 --> 14:44.054
Definitely.

14:44.415 --> 14:48.701
And thinking about the book's title, The Whole Story, and that idea of a purposeful life.

14:49.162 --> 14:49.342
Right.

14:49.382 --> 14:55.511
Makes you think how those early seeds, the adventure, the philosophy, the co-op community, weren't just about building a business.

14:55.991 --> 15:03.522
No, they were laying the groundwork for a whole life philosophy, one that tried to blend personal growth with, you know, conscious business.

15:03.839 --> 15:05.701
So here's something to maybe chew on.

15:06.703 --> 15:19.720
Reflecting on Mackie's early motivations, those initial drives and challenges, the search for meaning, the desire for adventure, building community, facing setbacks, what parts of that resonate with how you think about crafting your own whole story?

15:21.061 --> 15:22.523
Yeah, definitely something to ponder.

15:22.884 --> 15:23.164
It is.

15:23.364 --> 15:25.307
Well, thanks for taking this deep dive with us today.
